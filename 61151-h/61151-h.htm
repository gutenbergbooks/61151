<p>Let no one who shall do me the honor to
read this little book suppose that I have been
&ldquo;laying down a lot of rules.&rdquo; The most
that I have attempted is to point out some
of those regulations which the experiences of
thoughtful men and women of the world have
found necessary to good social order, as well
as some of those things that a long experience
in work for the unfortunate has discovered
as requisite to the prevention of
scandals and consequent ostracism.</p>
<p>To have seen conscientious young men
and women struggling against the awful current
of popular reproach because of certain
things in conduct which, while innocent to
them, have inevitably aroused suspicion in
a suspicious world, is to at least wish to help
those who have asked help, or who are willing
to receive it, to the end that they may
<span class="pb" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
acquire that sort of knowledge which shall
enable them to avoid such peril and contempt.</p>
<p>The questions which appear in these pages
are bona fide questions, written and sent to
me by those who asked them for themselves
or others. The positions taken are all based
on what I believe to be principles which
must lie at the foundation of any social life
that would keep itself unspotted from the
world, and which can be used as a testimony
to the gospel in the sight of a wicked and
untoward generation.</p>
<p>I have not written for the world. Many
writers have done that. Nor have I written
for the nominal Christian; but for those who
are earnestly looking for the best means of
serving God and humanity, while they are
also looking for that blessed hope,&mdash;the glorious
appearing of our Lord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good form&rdquo; is especially a society
phrase, but it is full of meaning, such
as has a direct bearing on even the life and
walk of a missionary. It is of sufficient importance
to engage the attention of any who
would become cultured, and is practical and
simple enough to become a subject of study
in the most common, isolated home, in which
children are growing up.</p>
<p>It is in good and bad form that is found
a large share of all that difference which
distinguishes the lady or gentleman from
the slattern and the boor; and in the consideration
given to this question of <i>manners</i>
it is once again true that &ldquo;the children of
this world are wiser than the children of
light.&rdquo; Luke 16:8.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>One of the first efforts that men or women
will make if they have an &ldquo;ax to grind,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;something to borrow,&rdquo; will be to appear
well. If they have anything &ldquo;to push,&rdquo; an
advantage to secure, which makes it necessary
that some influential people shall be
&ldquo;won over&rdquo; to some certain way of thinking,
they will study every movement, turn,
and word; learn tact, self-control, or anything
else by which they can hope to succeed.</p>
<p>Many a man has practised facial expression
for hours before a mirror, not for amusement,
but for <i>business</i>; to the end that he
might tone down or eradicate certain lines
which would make an unfavorable impression
upon those whom he met, and has carefully
cultivated in their place those that would
be sure to give him a better introduction
among those whom he intended to use to
his own profit or pleasure. This is constantly
done in the interests of self, and has
often resulted in forwarding those mercenary

and sometimes criminal ends for which it
was designed.</p>
<p>For the same purpose men learn grace of
carriage,&mdash;how to enter and leave a room,
how to moderate every tone; and practise
laboriously in private, to fix as habit anything
which they believe to be desirable, and
eradicate anything that would be a hindrance,
so that they may never be taken off guard
by any rush of feeling, and so jeopardize
the selfish interests which are at stake.</p>
<p>For the same end little children are put
into training of the most exacting sort, and
grow up almost perfect copies of some great
master in certain forms which, while in themselves
empty, yet are like buckets, capable of
holding anything. And until Christians are
willing to labor as faithfully to become winsome
themselves, and train their children to
do the best of all work in the best of all
forms, they have not yet come to love the
truth as the world loves self.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>The truth is to be carried to all people,
high and low. A boor, who loves the truth,
and who is filled with the Holy Spirit, may
do a good work in some lines. If he has
had no opportunities to know how to carry
himself among men, except such knowledge
as comes by being a Christian, God will
keep him where he can be used, and will use
him to his glory, and give him sheaves to
bring home at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be a Christian&rdquo; is an easy answer to
the question, &ldquo;How shall I conduct myself
in such and such a case?&rdquo; But a man may
be a Christian, and yet, for the lack of some
specific instruction in certain forms of procedure,
perpetrate a blunder which will
bring the laugh from the profane whom he
wished to arouse to sober thought; or make
a mistake, such as will carry and widely
scatter a serious misunderstanding by which
Christ will be reproached and his work
hindered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>I am confident that in every home among
all good Christian people there is a genuine
desire to attain to the best training in everything
that will make this best of all work go
swiftly to the ends of the earth; but I am
also sure that many have failed to appreciate
that &ldquo;<i>the</i> cause&rdquo; has a right to be carried
by the most perfect methods to which it is
possible to attain. The truth is worthy of
the best of all &ldquo;good form&rdquo; in home, church,
and social life. Good form does not consist
so much in putting on, as in putting off&mdash;<i>keeping</i>
off&mdash;those things in deportment,
speech, and association which are especially
ungraceful, unwinsome, incorrect, and
improper.</p>
<p>Social good form, although it seems to be
of the world, worldly, represents just what
Christ would do if he were living among
men and women in ordinary social relations.
The world has taken the best that worldly
wisdom can comprehend of the Christ-life,
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
and carefully embodied it in a certain code
to which it professes to hold itself; to which
it does hold itself in public, whatever it may
do behind the scenes.</p>
<p>It is manifestly true that the man who has
the mind of Christ ought to grow, apple-tree
fashion, as much of courtesy, gentleness,
and all that goes to make an agreeable appearance,
as the world can possibly buy in
the market of good manners, tie on and wear,
Christmas-tree fashion.</p>
<p>It is by his first appearance that the colporteur
will open or close a door to the truth
which he carries in a book, or in samples of
health food. His manner in the homes
where he is entertained, in public, on the
train, the street, at camp-meeting, or on the
platform, will close or open the hearts of
even the hungry to the spiritual food which
the minister is sent forth to serve in the
Master&rsquo;s name. The <i>manner</i> of those who
occupy the field will play no insignificant
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
part in the work of building up the school,
the college, the mission, and in reaching the
uttermost parts with the gospel; and since
the children now under training in the homes
of Christian workers must have a share in
the work of God in this time when it means
more than it ever did for the servants of God
to carry weights and hindrances, it seems a
good thing to take up the consideration of
what constitutes &ldquo;Good Form,&rdquo; or practical
Christian conduct.</p>
<p>I have had my attention called to this
subject by questions from young people, as
well as parents; and this message concerning
how to meet people and handle the things of
this mundane sphere is to both parent and
child, boys, girls, and young people, who
are preparing for earnest work in the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">II.</span></h2>
<p>Social life is important to the young; it
can not be safely ignored in school life,
therefore I must have these interests in mind
as I write, and shall hope to help both the
anxious parent and the thoughtful young
student who would know how to do the right
thing at all times.</p>
<p>It is, however, a great deal more important
to <i>be</i> than to <i>do</i>; for it is out of the
<i>being</i> that the <i>doing</i> must come. The point
requiring the most anxious consideration is
that we may learn to truly know and love
the principle upon which safe conduct
depends.</p>
<p>He who loves purity for its own sake&mdash;who
hates impurity because of its vileness,
instead of for the painful consequences which
follow its practise, will never go very far
astray from those manners which are of good
report in any society on earth. He will
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
instinctively avoid the appearance of evil as
far as he knows how evil appears.</p>
<p>There are a few principles which are
always a safeguard and defense to those who
will be controlled by them, which if woven
into familiar thought will render correctness
in the details of conduct spontaneous and
inevitable. And yet circumstances may
modify this fact. It is sometimes slow work
to get hold of a principle; and some specific
teaching as to just what to do, and what not
to do, will often be a great help to even
those who are pure of heart, and have a
mind to avoid the appearance of evil.</p>
<p>Every detail of life must take note of the
fact that the human unit called man was
created male and female, and must begin his
earthly career as boy and girl, each at best
but a half of this unit. This, with many
correlated facts, must be kept before us in
the process of training. Up to a certain
period boys and girls can play together and
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
associate with perfect unconsciousness of any
difference between them, but the careful
parent and teacher must be alert with reference
to the time when nature awakens, after
which their association can only be safely
on two lines,&mdash;Christian work and general
good fellowship; and these always under the
chaperonage of some reliable and mature
woman. This is especially necessary in all
lines of work to which Christian young people
in these days of special activity among
the youth would be urged, such as missionary
meetings, cottage meetings, Sabbath-school,
house-to-house visiting. Without such chaperonage,
boys and girls, young men and
young women, should never go together, even
in Christian work; but girls by themselves,
and boys by themselves.</p>
<p>This is made necessary by the fact that
nature has been perverted, that the enemy
of all purity has taken possession of every
avenue of thought, even from the cradle,
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
and has filled the mind of childhood with
unprofitable imaginings, for which the only
cure is the knowledge of the truth pure and
simple, adapted to their comprehension, and
such opportunities for association as shall
make them mutual helps without stimulating
that self-consciousness that leads to curiosity
and evil suggestion.</p>
<p>Any allusion which would give the children
an idea of the anxious thoughts which
you entertain for them should be studiously
avoided. Teach and practise them in all
which constitutes true decorum while they
are still too young to understand its significance
and necessity, so that when the time
comes that the youth shall need &ldquo;good
form&rdquo; habits for the protection of a good
name, he will have them already, as a part
of that second nature which good breeding
produces. The first teaching will naturally
apply without any reference to sex differences,
to that conduct which should prevail
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
between a company of girls and boys each
in companies by themselves.</p>
<p>First, as to manners in public. Boys and
girls should grow up with the idea that it is
a great deal nicer for girls to keep each
other company, and for boys to do the
same, than for boys and girls to go together.
Teach your boy to protect the girls of his
acquaintance from any annoyance which his
presence anywhere could produce. Make
him understand that carefulness in this regard
is the beginning of genuine manliness.
Teach both boys and girls to be reserved
and modest in their deportment toward all
other boys and girls alike, boys toward boys,
and girls toward girls. That boisterous familiarity
among boys together is so unbecoming
as always to breed contempt.</p>
<p>By this I would not have my readers infer
that good form in behavior must in the least
interfere with the &ldquo;good times&rdquo; that children
and youth ought to enjoy. It does not
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
prevent that happy freedom which can alone
make real &ldquo;play&rdquo; possible. Running, jumping,
climbing trees, shouting, hallooing, can
all be done without any violation of a single
principle of good form as applied to childhood
life. The trouble is that many parents and
teachers have the idea that any form of conduct
to be &ldquo;good&rdquo; must be grown-up and
gray-headed, whereas one of the very worst
of bad forms is for a child to appear <i>old</i>.
Good form, the genuine sort, like every other
good thing, will admit of any conduct which
will promote strength of body, soul, and
spirit. Real strength, which must always include
the whole being, is perfectly safe, and
a perpetual source of joy in the Holy Guest.
Many popular plays and games, however, are
so far removed from every principle which
should control action and association, that
they can not be indulged without rudeness,
brutality, and in many cases that sort of
familiarity which leads to immorality, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
should be thrown into the heap with all
other bad manners.</p>
<p>It is bad form for two, three, or more persons
to walk in an irregular huddle on the
street, as children sometimes do, going backward
facing the rear of the procession in order
that conversation may be carried on.
Even young children should be taught that
the running, leaping, jumping, loud talking
and laughter, which would be all right in the
back yard, on some playground, or in the
open country, is never to be indulged on the
public street; that the moment the street is
reached the deportment should become quiet,
and have thoughtful reference to the comfort
of the public.</p>
<p>They should understand the obvious reasons
for this: A running child is practically
a blind and deaf one; he must have plenty
of room, or he will be almost sure to collide
with something or somebody; in town will
be in danger of teams or cars. The rule for
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
the street should be: Steady, quiet, careful,
eyes to the front, no loud talking or laughing,
no play, no swapping of knives, no
reading, no chewing or eating, no clearing
the throat or spitting if it can possibly be
avoided. If this last is impossible, let it
be done in the most unobtrusive manner,
behind a kerchief; in short, let nothing be
done which would inevitably draw the attention
of passers-by, causing special notice
and comment.</p>
<p>The craze for notoriety manifests itself in
a thousand repulsive forms of street behavior,
through which the grossest temptations
attack the untaught and careless; and those
parents who would protect their children
from many nameless dangers must teach
them good form as applied to street life.</p>
<p>Nowhere does good breeding reveal itself
more quickly than in the quiet, unobtrusive
&ldquo;I-am-minding-my-own-business&rdquo; air of the
girl or boy, who, with an armful of books
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
held closely, looking neither to the right nor
to the left, clips to and from school; or if
walking and talking together by twos, it is
with steady carriage and voices so modulated
that no passer-by will overhear a word, nor
think of being jostled.</p>
<p>Children should be taught by both word
and example that when they are about to
meet any person on the street they should
fall back into single file at the right, while
still far enough distant as to obviate all
danger of interference. Who has not found
himself caught on the street in a mob of
schoolgirls or boys, often both together, who
needlessly monopolize the walk, as with loud
talking, wrangling, jesting, jaws working at
both words and gum, they publish as upon
the housetop the utter lack of good form in
the homes from which they have come?
The first blame for this disgusting spectacle
always falls upon the children; but in truth
it all belongs to the homes out of which they
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
have tumbled pell-mell without that instruction
and those fixed habits which would have
insured decorum and decency.</p>
<p>Every child should be taught to give courteous
recognition to acquaintances. The
boys should lift the cap to each other as well
as to their elders, always to father and
mother, if they chance to meet them on the
street; and the girls by some modest feminine
salute of bow or word. But some one
may object that it seems &ldquo;far-fetched&rdquo; to
train boys to this formal mannerism. To
which I reply in the old adage that the &ldquo;boy
is father of the man.&rdquo; The man in every
relation in life will follow the lead of boyish
habits unless indeed in the interests of some
great conviction or self-interest he makes
all things new. This can be done, but even
then the traces of early habits will often
remain to bring shame and confusion at
some critical point when pleasure or profit
are at stake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">III.</span></h2>
<p>The social life of boys and girls should be
recognized and provided for as a department
of the school in which they shall become
educated in those things which make for
social righteousness and purity later on. As
boys treat each other, they will, as a rule,
treat each other as men. As boys and girls
behave toward each other, so will they as a
rule behave as men and women. Courtesy
is necessary to the highest degree of success
in any enterprise. The boy who is habitually
courteous toward other boys will be successful
in winning his way as a man among
men with any important message with which
he may be commissioned; and if he is so
instructed that he is gentle, considerate, and
true to his mother, sisters, and girl associates,
he will be a safe friend as a man, a representative
of Christ to his own wife and children,
and help to make that home which must
stand as a witness for God in the last days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>The children in whose interests I am writing
must be in a peculiar sense messengers
of light to the world. They will be on the
field of action in the very last scenes of the
earth&rsquo;s history, when souls must be <i>snatched</i>
by a power of which we have little comprehension&mdash;the
power to <i>win quickly</i>; the
power to reveal the truth as in a flash of
light, so that it will be recognized at sight
by the bewildered, desperate soul that has
awakened at the last moment to its peril and
privilege, and with scant space for repentance
and cleansing, cries out for help; and
the Holy Spirit must find somewhere those
whom he can train and use for the service
which in those days must be done to reach
<i>every</i> creature, high as well as low, with
the gospel.</p>
<p>The truth is worthy of the best possible
investment. Its messengers should be free
from every offensive habit, custom, and
manner&mdash;thoroughly equipped in all that is
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
most graceful, most scholarly, as genuine
Christian scholarship goes; most refined,
most chaste, and agreeable in both public
and private intercourse. They should be
the most suitably, and that means the most
simply and tastefully, dressed.</p>
<p>The theory of the world considers as
&ldquo;good form&rdquo; that each individual should
dress according to the <i>class</i> which he represents;
and the Christian who conscientiously
and consistently dresses as his name &ldquo;Christian&rdquo;
would indicate that he should dress,
will be respected by even the frivolous &ldquo;butterfly
of fashion,&rdquo; and will stand a good
chance of a hearing by that same &ldquo;butterfly,&rdquo;
even in the most solemn message, provided
it is accompanied with the simple, easy
courtesy of good breeding, such as can not
be suddenly assumed &ldquo;for effect,&rdquo; but which
is the result of life-long training. There are
honest souls among so-called &ldquo;social butterflies,&rdquo;
and some workers must be trained
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
to go out into the <i>highways</i> where they flit
away their hopeless lives, as well as into the
byways and hedges, where social wrecks are
huddled in darkness and desolation.</p>
<p>The men and women who must do this
work are now boys and girls in our homes
or schools, and very much which shall determine
the scope of their influence depends
upon what the Spirit of God shall find available
in them for use. A truly well-trained,
courteous man or woman can be used <i>anywhere</i>,
among <i>any</i> people; while the uncouth
and untrained must be kept in a limited
sphere. The truly cultured man or woman
whose every gift and grace has been sanctified
and consecrated, will be more sure to
know what to do in the homes of the wretched
and the haunts of vice for the alleviation of
distress and the saving of a soul than those
who have never thought it worth while to
cultivate winsome qualities.</p>
<p>God has so arranged human life and relations
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
that even the most aristocratic and
exclusive must take note of, and plan for doing,
the same every-day things that are alike
common to all; and the only question of
deportment which can ever come between
the uncouth and the refined, concerns the
methods of doing these same most common
things.</p>
<p>The mother in the humblest home, with
the most meager opportunities, if she has a
high enough appreciation of the mission to
which her child is called as a representative
of the precious &ldquo;faith of Jesus,&rdquo; can, in
him, place at the disposal of the Holy Spirit
such graces of gentleness, such a beauty of
holiness, such winsome kindliness, such tact
and address, as shall open the way for anything
which he has to bring. But to do this she
must begin with the child in his relation to
the other children of his own age with whom
he stands on an equal footing. To treat
with deference and politeness only those
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
who because of age or position are recognized
as his superiors, would train the child
to sychophancy.</p>
<p>The man who can <i>lead</i> other men, except by
some appeal to selfish or brutal passion, is very
hard to find. A &ldquo;<i>man&rsquo;s way</i>&rdquo; has passed into
proverb, and stands for heedlessness as regards
his treatment of his equals. His natural
sense of pity will make him kind to the helpless,
provided he can afford it; he will be
respectful to the respectable because his own
respectability requires it; and his general
interest will lead him to <i>court</i> those who are
in a position to bestow favors; but to be all
that a consecrated Christian companion
might be to those who are on the same plane
with himself, or who are so outlawed by
public sentiment that no accuser but conscience
would arise against him for any
wrong done to them, is the point of
failure in the association of men with men
and women, and is the result of an almost
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
universal idea that &ldquo;boys don&rsquo;t need to be
so very polite to each other,&rdquo; nor &ldquo;so very
particular&rdquo; as to just how they talk when
alone among themselves, and that the silly
girl or &ldquo;fallen&rdquo; among women is legitimate
prey for any man.</p>
<p>It is by &ldquo;<i>behavior</i>&rdquo; that men and women
are protected from, or exposed to, especial
and peculiar temptations, as well as made
more or less effective in truth-teaching and
soul-winning.</p>
<p>It may seem ridiculous to make the use
of a handkerchief the subject of grave consideration,
but it is a terrible fact that this
little scrap of linen has become more dangerous
than dynamite to the thoughtless girl
in her teens who, for lack of proper teaching,
picks up the little tricks of street flirtation,
which have so defiled it that it has
become almost indecent to handle it outside
the seclusion of one&rsquo;s own room.</p>
<p>Let a bright-faced girl take her handkerchief
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
in hand on the street of even a small
country village, and she will immediately become
the center of attraction to every lewd
fellow who haunts public places, until he has
found out what she intends to do with it;
and the code of signals for which it is employed
is of such a character that the most
innocent may be charged with a lewd invitation
by what might seem to be its necessary
use.</p>
<p>The same is true concerning the sound
made by clearing the throat and nasal passages,
and coughing. These are all used as
signals of vice; and many a giddy, but innocent
girl has found herself in situations of
great humiliation and danger, simply because
she had not been forearmed with a little
knowledge as to proper conduct in these
matters.</p>
<p>Good form requires that the handkerchief
be carried in the pocket out of sight; <i>never</i>
brought out in public excepting in a case of
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
necessity, and then used as unobtrusively
as possible. The importance of this matter
is sufficient to warrant repetition even to line
upon line and precept upon precept.</p>
<p>Those who will be able to do the best
service in the closing work of the world&rsquo;s
history, to win the richest trophies for our
coming King, will be those who, together
with the &ldquo;commandments of God and the
faith of Jesus,&rdquo; and the fulness of the Holy
Spirit, will know and observe in deportment
that which the world recognizes as good
form.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">IV.</span></h2>
<p>The whole social problem, as regards pure
living, home-making, and domestic comfort,
depends on how young people, as such,
shall deport themselves toward each other.</p>
<p>Some good people have seemed to suppose
that, provided the children were converted,
everything else would take care of
itself, so that any specific instruction in
&ldquo;<i>manners</i>&rdquo; must be superfluous, if not foolish.
This is a fallacy of the same order as
that which assumes that if a man is called of
God to preach the gospel he needs no education
or preparation, only to stand up,
open his mouth, and give his vocal organs a
chance to play, leaving God to do the rest;
when the fact is that God will make good
use of every faculty, and all the culture that
is provided for him, but of <i>no more</i>. The
name Christian should stand for the very
best that is possible in education. Many a
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
Christian man has brought reproach on
the name of Christ, not because his heart
was bad, but because his manners were.
Many a woman of pure purpose, who would
not have committed a gross act for the
world, has alienated her husband, made her
neighbors suspicious, and lost her good
name, just because she did not know what
things were of good report, and therefore
what must be of evil report. And these
disasters resulted from lack of proper training
in the early home on some points that
seem too trivial to think about twice, and
which, doubtless, many will feel have no
place in a dignified discussion anywhere.
And yet since these small things concern so
much of weal or woe, so much of honor or
shame, we may well afford to take time for
their consideration.</p>
<p>One of the things most commonly seen,
and about which all the world smiles, is a
boy and girl standing on opposite sides of
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
the gate which opens toward her home.
They have walked from school or church together,
she has entered and closed the gate,
and paused a moment for another word; he
has taken this as an invitation to linger, and
so they stand laughingly or seriously chatting,
sometimes long after dark. The world
calls it coquetry, but the young people do
not mean it as such; to them it is probably
far removed from every evil thought. They
are innocent and honest; but you can not
make the world, that is looking for evil, believe
that they are not consciously flirting.
It will estimate them accordingly, and soon
begin to say, &ldquo;That girl knows quite as much
as she ought to;&rdquo; and the good Christian
people of the community will grow
afraid of her as an associate for their daughters,
even if those same daughters do the
same thing.</p>
<p>These children have seen older young
people, perhaps mother and the minister,
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
stand and talk and laugh in the same way.
Some may ask, &ldquo;Well, why not?&rdquo; Because
it is not <i>good form</i>, because a bad
social savor attaches to it, because, no matter
who does it, unless they are very aged,
or are, like C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s wife, absolutely above
suspicion (and who can venture to assume
such a thing for himself), they will lose in
dignity, suffer in reputation, become the
butt of some sly joke from the class of people
who need the help that can only be
given by men and women who do not &ldquo;allow
their good to be evil spoken of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If children and young people form the
habit of stopping to talk at the gate, they
will do it as men and women; and by doing
it, draw the evil eye, and invite gossip.
Teach your boy and girl that good form requires
that when they arrive at the gate, if
they wish to continue the conversation,
both should go on into the house together;
or that, after he has opened the gate and
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
closed it after her, she should promptly say
&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; and
he should as promptly lift his hat, and walk
away. If they enter the house together,
good form requires that he, if he be young
or old, should receive a family greeting,
and that the members of the family shall be
free to come to the parlor or sitting-room to
which he has been taken, to remain and
share in the conversation if they wish, until
the call is ended.</p>
<p>Two young people should never suppose
that they must sit in a parlor with closed
doors; that father, mother, and every one
else must be kept out of the way because
Nellie&rsquo;s friend (never call him a beau) has
come to spend the evening. They should
never consider it possible to extend that
evening into and past the large hours of the
night. This is one of Satan&rsquo;s most fruitful
wrecking devices, of which the young people
will never think, themselves, unless their
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
training has tended to push them off away
from their natural social guides, and keep
bad social models before them.</p>
<p>When the boy, or young man, comes to
spend an evening because you have a daughter,
give him just as much of yourself as
possible; make yourself so indispensable to
the young people that they will naturally
come to you wherever you prefer to sit,
rather than try to entertain each other without
you. This is not an unheard of thing,
although one will sometimes hear Christian
people answer to this teaching as if it
were very extreme indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How then will a young man be able to
say anything special to the girl?&rdquo; To which
it may be answered that if he is not able to
find some way which is perfectly consistent
with every principle of decorum, he is not
worth listening to; and if that is true of him,
it will be because he did not have his share
of the right sort of home life and training.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>In the social world, where Good Form is as
binding as the Decalogue is to the Christian,
fathers and mothers have made it impossible
for a young woman to think of entertaining
her young man friend shut away alone with
him. Strange to say, it has been the modest
home, the Christian parent, who has
allowed Satan to set this trap for unwary
feet by leaving the young daughter, without
one word of instruction, to entertain some
young man, perhaps a stranger, who passed
as her lover, shut away in the &ldquo;parlor,&rdquo;
while everybody was given to understand
that no one must disturb the mysterious
solemnities of &ldquo;keeping company,&rdquo; even if
they should continue into the small hours.
And as a result of this disregard of simple
good form, which is as a fence against recognized
danger, untold sin and sorrow have
resulted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">V.</span></h2>
<p>The most worldly society decided long
ago that it is very &ldquo;bad form&rdquo; for boys and
girls of school age to think of <i>lovers</i>, of engagements,
or of marriage. Not until the
day of childish things is entirely passed, not
until a young man has some settled purpose
in life, some business or profession which
insures an income, does &ldquo;Good Society,&rdquo; as
it is called, smile upon any &ldquo;serious intentions&rdquo;
between young people, and every effort
is made to hold the children of the
social world to this regulation.</p>
<p>All this is because of the fact which can
not be repudiated that premature thinking
along these channels is unhealthy, and disqualifies
the youth for any real earnest
preparation for practical life.</p>
<p>The world theoretically considers these
preparatory years so important, and education
so vital, that with every possible device
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
it seeks to keep the children unconscious
of sex, and of the burdens which this consciousness
always brings, until they have
attained something like maturity.</p>
<p>Of course the world fails, because it is trying
to do by sheer force of human will, and
by human methods from outside influence,
that which can only be accomplished by the
growing from within of a divinely planted
principle. But that which the world is struggling
after, that about which it has made so
many laws, has written and talked so much,
and in which it is so often foiled, Christian
parents ought to find practical and easy,
because of the power of the Spirit which always
accompanies every truth.</p>
<p>It is a fact, however, that many worldly
homes have succeeded at this point, because
they have faithfully taught the principle, even
if without prayer or faith; while many Christian
homes have failed, with all their praying
and so-called faith, because they have ignored
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
the principle that marriage is for men
and women, not for children; and that any
association which takes cognizance of sex
must be for marriage only; that if it is for
any other object, it is coquetry, flirting, and
consequently immoral.</p>
<p>This should be so faithfully taught to the
growing child, and all words and conduct in
home and Christian social life should be so
under the control of this principle, and he
should be so taught those habits of social
intercourse which will protect him from premature
and unhealthy thought, that he shall
be able to grow up to the time of his own
home-making untrammeled by the entanglements
of unhallowed associations and their
distracting memories.</p>
<p>Here again the boundaries of safety are
marked by things which seem trivial. The
social world counts it as &ldquo;bad form&rdquo; for
young people to even shake hands upon introduction,
because it has found out to its
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
shame and disgrace that there is danger in
a hand-shake; and I am free to say that this
social extreme is better than the freedom
which sometimes obtains, because by that
the young people become practised in a
looseness of conduct which opens the way
for trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good form&rdquo; toned down from the extreme
rigidity of the social world, so as to
meet the requirements of ordinary Christian
intercourse, would teach that the hand-shake
should be just what its name indicates&mdash;a
clasp, a shake, and then a <i>drop</i>. Teach
your son that he should never place any
lady in the embarrassing position of having
her hand <i>crushed</i>, or <i>held</i> one second; for if
she has been properly taught, she will be
sure that he is either ignorant, careless, or
ungentlemanly in so doing; and if she is
herself ignorant and careless, if she is weak
enough to allow her hand to be held, she is
in a condition where she needs to be protected
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
from herself; and your son should be
able to be that protector.</p>
<p>Teach your daughter that if any man
clings to her fingers when she has given
him her hand in friendly, cordial fashion, if
he takes the liberty of placing his other hand
under her elbow, or taking hold of her arm,
that it is her privilege and duty to teach him
that he has committed a breach of good
manners by withdrawing her hand, forcibly
if she must, and stepping out of his reach.
And any young man who is worthy of her
friendship will in his heart thank her for the
rebuke, and profit by it.</p>
<p>Many a boy who has grown up in a family
of sisters, and among their friends, has, in
going out into the world, had to suffer over
and over such tortures of chagrin and shame
as were almost unendurable before he could
learn those little things in &ldquo;good form&rdquo;
which should have been taught him by precept
and example in his home from childhood;
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
and for a lack of the right teaching in
this &ldquo;hand-to-hand&rdquo; relation, many a boy
has been taken captive by shameless women,
simply because he practised in the wider
and more wicked world the free habits which
were common in the neighborhood life at
home, which, while neither right nor safe
there, were not absolutely dangerous, because
each knew everybody, and all were
held to respectability by the short rein of
close social relations.</p>
<p>Teach your daughter that it is not &ldquo;good
form&rdquo; to allow a young man in walking
with her to support her steps in any way,
unless she has suffered some sudden injury.
A sprained ankle would excuse any necessary
help until a carriage could be called;
or, if this were out of the question, until
she was taken home. If she must have
help, let her take his arm, and <i>hold on</i>; but
teach your boy never to place his hand on a
lady&rsquo;s wrist, and lay her arm along his own,
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
holding her by hand and elbow. This is a
most vulgar method of supporting any excepting
one&rsquo;s own wife, sister, mother, or
some aged woman.</p>
<p>There is no possible reason why any
young woman, who is in health, should,
even after dusk, need support from any
man. She ought to be able to keep her
place in the road or field, or on the sidewalk,
just as well as he can, and walk independently
of his hand or arm. The notion
that a woman must have a man&rsquo;s arm for
support is off the same loaf with all the other
nonsense which belongs to all the rest of
that &ldquo;clinging-vine theory&rdquo; which assumes
that she is of necessity so much the weaker
as to need his constant attention and care,
especially as long as she is young and attractive.
The <i>old</i> and wrinkled woman can as a
rule take care of herself.</p>
<p>Woman has been made weaker than man
by the sinful habits of life to which social
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
custom condemned and held her during the
Dark Ages. This subjugation was her part
of the entailed curse. But from this, with
all its disabilities, she is to become free in
Christ; and our daughters trained in Christian
homes should at least be able to walk
anywhere that a young woman ought to go
without leaning on some man for support.</p>
<p>How much more graceful are the movements
of men and women as they walk together,
keeping step, but far enough apart so that
each is perfectly free, than when locked together
by the arms, especially in daylight,
on a smooth path.</p>
<p>As age comes on, it is a beautiful thing to
see a son or daughter supporting the steps
of father, mother, or grandparents; but it is
a pathetic scene, the beauty of which depends
entirely upon its necessity. As a
show of any special regard which two people
may have for each other, it is ridiculous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">VI.</span></h2>
<p>Good form requires that in passing
through a door or gate the younger shall
always stand aside for the elder, and that
care shall be taken to open and keep the
door, especially if it swings both ways, so
that it shall not hit any one in coming to.</p>
<p>I was once forcibly reminded of this article
of the &ldquo;good-form&rdquo; code by seeing a
vigorous young college student rush through
a door without any regard to an elderly
woman whom he met in the passage, and
whom he almost knocked off her feet in the
encounter, leaving the outside door to swing
back against her slender hand as she caught
it to prevent its hitting her in the face. He
seemed utterly oblivious to the fact that he
had met any one, and by this unconscious
rudeness he published abroad the fact that
he had been reared in utter disregard of ordinary
courtesy. This young man is trying
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
to do what is right; he wishes to do a good
work in the world, but he is destined to
feel the handicap of bad breeding, for which
he is not responsible. He will be responsible,
however, for continuance in bad form;
for bad breeding may be made temporary
in its effects by an earnest purpose to replace
it by true culture. I knew a young
man whose birth and surroundings in boyhood
were as unpromising as could be imagined.
His father was a very low, ignorant,
drunken fellow, unclean and disgusting in all
his habits, even when sober. His mother
could neither read nor write, although she
was possessed of intelligence and many
true, womanly instincts, such as made it
possible for the hovel in which they lived to
bear some semblance to a home. This boy,
who was the eldest of a large family, was
bright enough to attract the attention of a
&ldquo;district visitor,&rdquo; was clothed, and taken to
the Sunday-school, and from thence went on
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
through a career of self-denial, self-training,
and culture, always seeking the best things,
holding every advantage gained from point
to point, finishing his preparatory work as
one of the most polished and consecrated
young men of a large college circle, paying
his way by skilled labor in a machine-shop
for a few hours each week, while he was being
equipped for a large field of usefulness.
He became especially distinguished for the
elegance of his deportment toward all with
whom he chanced to be brought into association.
It was often said, &ldquo;He never forgets
himself,&rdquo; &ldquo;He always does the admirable
thing,&rdquo; &ldquo;You can depend on <i>him</i> to do
the elegant always,&rdquo; and the beauty of it all
was that this was a part of his Christian life.
He was always wanted, but the social world
that coveted him knew that he could not be
<i>had</i> for anything that was inconsistent with
Christ.</p>
<p>Teach your boys and girls this principle
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
of deference to their elders, by example, as
well as precept. Bring them up to practise
it, with every other expression of cultivated
manners, among themselves as brothers and
sisters. The elder ones should, of course,
never demand deference; that would be
the worst of all bad forms. No true lady
or gentleman will ever notice any disregard
of personal rights. To demand this recognition,
or to manifest resentment at its omission,
is to forfeit one&rsquo;s claim to it; but let
each be ready to recognize the right of seniority,
and that it is at least graceful for
the younger ones to yield place and position
to their elder brothers, sisters, and
friends.</p>
<p>A well-bred girl or woman will open and
hold the door for an old, elderly, or feeble
man; will enter after him, and close the
door herself, although he, if he has been
trained in the habits of the &ldquo;old school&rdquo;
of gentlemen, might insist on rendering to
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
her the courtesy due her sex, and wait for
her to pass, even if she should be young
enough to be his granddaughter; but it will
be a gracious act for her to unobtrusively
hold the humbler place which properly belongs
to her, and wait until he passes in,
unless, as might sometimes happen, she
would be in danger of attracting undue attention
by making longer effort to thwart his
courteous designs, as well as possibly cause
delay to others. In such a case she should
quietly thank him, and pass on as quickly as
she can without haste, so as to get out of
the way.</p>
<p>Among men and women of the same generation
it is expected that a man will be
always ready to perform all those little chivalric
courtesies for women everywhere which
he would like other men to tender to his own
mother, sister, wife, or special friend, and
<i>no more</i>. For a boy or man to treat any
other woman of the same age better than he
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
treats his own mother, sister, or wife, reveals
the bad, disloyal heart which will taint the
very best social &ldquo;good form&rdquo; with corruption.
To demand from others for one&rsquo;s personal
friends better treatment than he himself
gives, is to at once publish that he is guilty
of the most contemptible form of selfishness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I let no man abuse my folks but myself,&rdquo;
was the frank confession of a young
man who was always ready to fight any one
who would treat his &ldquo;folks&rdquo; with anything
like the neglect and disrespect that was his
constant habit.</p>
<p>The little attentions which should become
habits in youth, because they help to that
appearance which will serve as adornment to
every good doctrine, is the placing of the
chair in the most comfortable position possible
for another; seating grandfather or
grandmother, father or mother at the table;
the adjustment of a light; picking up the
article that has been dropped; not waiting to
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
be asked to help if you should see that father,
mother, or in fact, any one else, is looking
for something which they do not seem to be
able to find quickly, or if they are trying to
save your steps by getting along with some
inconvenience which you can see might, by
a little effort on your part, be made to give
place to convenience.</p>
<p>Nothing is ever lost &ldquo;in the long run&rdquo; by
that sort of thoughtful care for others which
is known as politeness. In traveling, or in
passing in and out of a crowded church or
hall, the truly well-bred man will never be
found struggling in the midst of a jam to
get through the door into the best seat, or
up into the train before any one else. If he
should be caught in a jam, he would not
elbow people right and left; but would,
while protecting his own person and those
who are dependent upon him from injury,
find his own chance of getting out of the
tight place by helping others out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>In this selfish world nothing so quickly
touches the popular heart as that sort of
Christlikeness which is recognized as politeness
to strangers in public places, and as
carefulness in helping the weak, and in refraining
from adding burdens to those who are
hard-pressed by responsibilities. The man
or woman who obtains control of the highest
quality of influence is the one who has either
from childhood been trained to think those
thoughts that blossom out into beautiful considerateness,
or who has taken himself in
hand, and by vigorous self-training has
pruned off the growth of selfish heedlessness,
and grafted in the gentler graces of the
Spirit.</p>
<p>One W. C. T. U. lecturer had been painfully
impressed by the fact that baggagemen
had to handle such heavy trunks. This was
before so many little wheeled contrivances
had been placed at their disposal. She accordingly
supplied herself with two small
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
trunks in place of the one large one, for no
other reason than to save the backs of the
men. Her kind intention was kept to herself
for years, and it went unrecognized at
its full value until at length one day she encountered
a grumpy old baggageman, who
seemed to have a special grudge against any
woman with two checks. He was from the
first moment very uncivil, and threatened
her with a charge for excess of baggage.
She said but little, only went quietly along
the baggage-room with him, identified the
two diminutive parcels, and waited. He
looked at them, then at her, colored like
one who was ashamed of himself, and
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be them all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, those are all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what made you make two of &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is my way of helping to lift one
big trunk,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your what?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;My way of helping you to lift one big
trunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is? Well, I never! You did it to
save our backs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes: I never wanted any old man or
boy to strain himself over a big trunk for
me, so I divided mine in two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; ejaculated the grumpy old fellow,
who evidently did not know anything
more to say. His whole heart had suddenly
mellowed, his eyes grew red, and his hands
trembled as, taking off his cap, he changed
those checks with the air of one who was
performing an act of religion.</p>
<p>When he came with the two little bits of
metal to the waiting passenger, still carrying
his cap in his hand, and when she took them
with a &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; and put them in her
purse, he looked timidly into her face as if
to see if he could possibly be forgiven. She
chose not to make much of the incident, so
she did not seem to notice his perturbation,
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
but with a simple &ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; left the baggage-room.
But she knew very well that
that old baggageman would never forget,
and would perhaps be kinder to all the big
trunks in the future for the sake of those
little twin products of her kind intention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">VII.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;How I wish I knew just how one ought
to behave in going into public places, meetings,
and lectures,&rdquo; said a young woman recently.
Others have asked similar questions.
I have heard something like this
more than once: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it dreadful not to
know the little things that would prevent
folks from looking at you and smiling in
such a mean way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is &ldquo;dreadful,&rdquo; as well as unnecessary
that children should be left to grow up
ignorant of any of those things, great or
small, which will make it possible for them
to enter the schoolroom, the church, the
hall, and move about in such a manner as
not to be objects of unpleasant observation
to those who make politeness a profession.</p>
<p>All that has been said about the opening
and closing of doors, and the rules of precedence,
are always in full force, and should
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
become so automatic that they will never
have to be <i>remembered</i>. Even at home, and
in the small country schoolhouse place of
worship they should be observed, if one
hopes to always do the &ldquo;nice way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a small congregation where &ldquo;everybody
knows everybody,&rdquo; there is a great
temptation to fall into very lax manners,
and so to cultivate habits that are hard to
overcome, and which will cause chagrin by
and by to the young man or woman who
wants to appear well among strangers.
Therefore it is wise to train the children to
such deportment in the small church, or
cottage meeting that they shall never be in
danger of bringing reproach on the home
which they have left behind them, by uncouth
or disorderly behavior in any public
assembly.</p>
<p>Any place of worship should be entered
quietly, children and parents together, single
file, in such order that there will be no
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
jostling, crowding, or changing of places.
There are two ways of seating a family,
either of which is good form. In one case
the father enters first, followed in order by
the mother, the youngest child, and then the
others according to age, so that the eldest
comes last. At the opening to the pew, or
row of chairs, the father turns, standing to
face the others, and waits until all have
passed in and are seated, when he takes his
place at the entrance. This arrangement
gives the mother the seat in the farther corner,
with the &ldquo;baby&rdquo; beside her, while the
eldest child is next to the father.</p>
<p>In the other case the eldest child leads,
and passes into the farther end of the seat,
followed by the other children in such order
as to leave the &ldquo;baby&rdquo; next to the mother,
who sits in the second place from the end,
beside her husband.</p>
<p>Sometimes when there is a large family, it
is necessary to separate the children by placing
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
the mother in the midst of them between
two restless ones. But whatever order
is necessary, let it be so matter-of-course
that the coming in and seating shall be in
that decorous manner which will impress the
children with the sacredness of the service
for which they have come.</p>
<p>Teach the child that in entering a seat or
row of chairs, good form requires that he
shall pass clear in to the farthest vacant
place, or that if he has dropped down in the
end or middle of the row, and others come
to claim seats beyond him, he should always
either arise, come out and stand to allow
them to pass in, or himself go on to the
farthest place. Teach him, never, under
any circumstances, to make it necessary for
any one to climb over his feet and legs to
reach a vacant place. This is one of the
most common and worst forms in which
bad training in deportment manifests itself.</p>
<p>Also teach your child to refuse to climb over
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
anybody&rsquo;s feet. Instruct him either to wait for
a decent chance to enter that seat or to find
another. The ludicrous, not to say unbecoming
appearance of a woman who tries to
drag herself over the knees of some man
who remains immovable in the end of the
seat, or who attempts to draw himself up to
&ldquo;make room&rdquo; for her to pass, is entirely
out of harmony with the spirit which should
prevail in a place of worship; and the
young man coming from home with this
habit, which has been formed by climbing
over his brothers and sisters, as well as
parents and guests, and letting them climb
over him, will be left some sad day to wonder
why people stop at the entrance to the
pew where he sits, wait an instant, look at
him so queerly, and then pass on, as if
they were not willing to occupy the same
seat with him. He may think it is because
he is from the country, because he is not
stylishly dressed, because they are very
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
&ldquo;stuck up,&rdquo; when it is simply because they
do not choose to climb over his legs to find
a seat.</p>
<p>But your daughter should be so taught that
if she must stand in the aisle and wait for
some man to get it into his head that he had
better move on, or come out so as to allow
her to pass, she shall do it kindly and without
contempt; for, of course, the poor fellow
would do better if he only knew how.</p>
<p>Teach by precept and example that wraps
and rubbers should not be put on until after
the benediction. If your boy should grow
up to the dignity of door-keeper in the
house of the Lord, he should know that
extra seats should never be removed from
the aisles, nor doors be opened, until the
last &ldquo;amen&rdquo; has been reverently uttered.</p>
<p>I believe that reverence and a proper
understanding of the meaning of the sacred
hours of worship would be wholesomely
inculcated by the practise of sitting down
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
in silence for two or three minutes after the
benediction, or long enough for any necessary
things to be done, such as the orderly
passing out of the congregation might require.</p>
<p>Good form requires that there be no loud
talking, visiting, laughing, bustling, or confusion
of any sort in the breaking up of a
congregation. In fact, instead of a breaking
up, it should be a melting away, each for
himself seeking to hold in thought, and
carry with him all that is possible of the
subject which has been considered, avoiding
everything which tends to dissipate or to
divert the mind from its contemplation.</p>
<p>This is the good form which <i>nominal</i>
Christians require and teach. It is only
the <i>form</i>, if you please, at the best dead, by
which the worldly professor seems to be trying
to make up what may be lacking in real
spiritual worship; but that very fact proves
it to be more than ordinarily worthy of consideration
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
and adoption by the most spiritual.
Upon the same principle that our righteousness
must exceed the righteousness of the
scribes and Pharisees should our courtesy
and good breeding exceed that of the most
cultivated people of the world.</p>
<p>That behavior which everybody recognizes
as becoming the house of the Lord, is
that which would most certainly distinguish
Jesus if he should come in among us; and
the true worshiper who will clothe himself
with these gentle, Christlike graces of conduct
will be no less truly a Christian, while
he will certainly be more quickly recognized
as such.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">VIII.</span></h2>
<p>One of the evils which the good-form
code is intended to control is that of the
money and gift obligations, and the part
they play in the association of young people;
and in this the burden of preserving the just
balance falls upon the young woman, although
it is equally necessary that both boys
and girls shall be so instructed that they
shall each contribute an equal share of that
mutual protection which good form is intended
to assure.</p>
<p>A sentiment still lingers in the social
world&mdash;a relic of medieval gallantry&mdash;to
the effect that a young man must grant anything
that a lady asks, even if, to secure it,
he must risk his life, or character, or the last
&ldquo;quarter&rdquo; with which he was to buy his
dinner. This asking on her part need not
be really <i>asking</i>: it may be only suggesting,
or consenting to accept. She may only
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
exclaim, &ldquo;Oh, wouldn&rsquo;t a sleigh-ride be just
too lovely for anything!&rdquo; She may have
become naughty enough, without intending
any harm, to say this on purpose to make
the boy whom she delights to tease begin
mentally to count over his small supply of
change to see if he can possibly afford the
rig. Girls have been known to take a queer
sort of delight in leading a young fellow on
to spend his last penny, to contract a debt,
and go hungry, because he did not bravely
refuse to take the hints that were intended
to lead him into expenditure such as he
could not afford.</p>
<p>No girl who has been properly trained, or
who has truth and the elements of womanliness
within, will ever resort to any such expedient
for her pleasure, but will keep herself
from all or any such social entanglements as
would lead to anything so base. She will not
allow a young man to place her under obligation,
even to the extent of car-fare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Teach your growing daughter that to
receive a gift of any sort from any boy or man
outside of the immediate circle of intimate,
well-known family friends, is dangerous, if not
disgraceful. Gift-giving and gift-receiving has
come to be a vice. It is often intended as a
sly, covert method of <i>buying</i> you. Gifts are employed
for &ldquo;padlocking the mouth&rdquo; of those
who know something which, if told, might
spoil some selfish or criminal plot; and this is
by no means confined to Tammany Hall.</p>
<p>Many a girl has kept some dangerous bit
of knowledge hidden in her secret thought,
and has been compromised by it, simply
because she had thoughtlessly accepted some
bauble from some man whom she supposed
to be a friend until, the ulterior motive being
revealed, she discovered that the gift was a
bribe, and its possession a confession of dishonor;
and then she has found herself in a
great strait between her desire to be free and
yet to keep the trinket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>I had given a plain talk to a company of
schoolgirls; and many questions had been
passed up to me, in answering which I had
touched some of these points. At the close
of the meeting, a few girls lingered to speak
to me, each waiting to ask some questions
&ldquo;all for herself alone.&rdquo; So while the others
waited at a safe distance, they came, one by
one, to whisper their perplexities in my ear.
How my heart was taken captive by those
girls, as with shamefacedness, with trembling
lips and burning cheeks, they asked me
questions which were revelations both of the
lack of early home teaching and of the
methods by which an evil world had tried to
make them wise!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have got afraid of a lovely necklace
that <i>my friend</i> gave me,&rdquo; said one of them.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wished a hundred times he hadn&rsquo;t
given it; but what in the world can I do
with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send it back to him,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;tell him
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
you know more now than you did when you
accepted it, and that you can not keep it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that would make him furious. I&mdash;I&mdash;dare
not make him angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if he is so dangerous, you certainly
dare not have him for a friend. If he
is worthy of your friendship, he will understand
and respect you all the more for this
course. If he is not worthy of your friendship,
the sooner you find it out, the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&mdash;but&mdash;,&rdquo; and the poor girl burst
into bitter weeping. Then after a few moments,
with a sudden firm resolution expressed
in her face, she dried her eyes,
looked up at me, clasped my hands as if to
hold herself by them, and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
do it right off,&mdash;and if he wants to
make it hard for me, he may. <i>I&rsquo;ve kept
honest</i>,&mdash;God knows I have,&mdash;and he knows
it, though <i>he</i> hasn&rsquo;t helped me, as he said he
would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He promised to help you?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did; he said I could trust <i>him</i>;
that he&rsquo;d never let a girl be compromised in
his company in the world; but if I had done,
and gone, as he insisted, lest if I didn&rsquo;t he
would have been provoked, I should have
been talked about long ago. I thank you so
much. I&rsquo;ll get rid of it. He may have his
old necklace, and keep it to give to his
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;She is the
only one who can wear or own it with
safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man with a good heart, who is
well taught in that which is best in good form,
will never offer to any lady outside his own
immediate family circle any gift but flowers;
and those in the most delicate unobtrusive
manner, such as will leave her, in receiving
them, absolutely free to pass them on to
some hospital patient if she chooses. To
make her feel, by even a look, that she is
under any obligation to wear a flower because
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
he sends it, is to rob it of its fragrance
and beauty, and make it fit only for the
dust heap.</p>
<p>Because of the possibilities which I have
suggested, and many others to which they
lead, good form requires that a young lady
shall make it practically impossible for any
man not intimately related to her to spend
any money, or force any gifts, upon her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">IX.</span></h2>
<p>I should not do my whole duty if I did
not make some reference to the &ldquo;holy
kiss,&rdquo; nor yet contribute what I can to
enlighten the mothers who honor me by
reading my book concerning the universal
but almost unspeakable questions that are
always coming into the minds of young people
about this sacred form of salute. <i>You</i>
may know as much about these questions as
I do, perhaps more; but there is many a
mother who never dreamed that they could
infest any brain but her own, and she never
dared speak of such a thing.</p>
<p>One girl came to me, her face suffused
with blushes, but with a determined expression
about her mouth, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to ask you something right
out plain, because I think you will not
laugh. I&rsquo;ve never dared ask anybody yet,
because everybody always laughs in such a
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
mean way if you try to find out anything
about such things; and I&rsquo;d like to know
how girls are going to know just what to do.
Now it&rsquo;s just this way: I am going with
Charley, and he is a nice boy; he wants to
do what is right, I know he does, but all
the boys have such queer ideas about their
&lsquo;rights.&rsquo; When he takes me home from
church or any place&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve just got so
I dread to have him; and sometimes I think
I won&rsquo;t go with another boy as long as I
live, because, you see, when I go to say
&lsquo;Good night,&rsquo; he&mdash;he thinks I am so queer
because I won&rsquo;t let him kiss me. But I
won&rsquo;t; I never let anybody but my own
folks. I don&rsquo;t like it. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s
nice to do that way unless it&rsquo;s somebody
you&rsquo;re sure of, and love very much. He
says I&rsquo;m queer; and he gets provoked, and
says it&rsquo;s his right, if he goes with me. Now
I want to know&mdash;is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it is not,&rdquo; I said, positively, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
perhaps with a little flavor of indignation.
&ldquo;And no properly instructed young man
would make such a claim. He is not to
blame, of course,&rdquo; I added more mildly,
&ldquo;for he is young, too; but your instincts are
all right; they are true; they are of God
who made the kiss, and gave it its own place
in common human language. It belongs to
the home, and to the purest Christian fellowship
between man and man, woman and
woman; <i>to society, never</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am so glad I asked you!&rdquo; she
said; &ldquo;for I was sure my feeling about it
was right. But you know one doesn&rsquo;t like to
offend one&rsquo;s friend, and one doesn&rsquo;t like to
be called queer. But what does make boys
act so,&mdash;good boys, too, for Charley <i>is</i> a
good boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I can not bring into the compass of these
pages all that followed in our talk, but I
would like to give the points of truth to the
young mothers for whom I write.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>The answer to my young questioner is
found in the fact that boys, as well as girls,
have been left in ignorance of the principle,
as it is in God, of which the kiss is one
form of expression, and have been left to
catch up its perversion as Satan has undertaken
to work it into custom and habit, in
the world. Anything which Satan can not
wholly spoil, he will counterfeit; or, better
yet for his purpose, make so common, if
possible, that it shall become worthless, as
was the case with silver in the days of Solomon,
when it became as the stones of the
street, and &ldquo;was nothing accounted of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kiss, made common, is ridiculous.
To be worth anything, it must speak exclusively
the language of a pure, changeless
affection, such as is represented in the love
of God for his children. It belongs more to
the parent and child, brother and sister, than
to friend and companion. It is, as before
intimated, fraternal, not social. As soon as
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
any attempt is made to drag it into society,
it becomes disgusting, and is always soon
driven out by storms of ridicule. Therefore
good form has taken it in hand, and has determined
its sphere and office with the most
arbitrary insistence. And again the voice
of society is but an echo of the voice of
truth and purity. Good form has decreed
that the kiss, public and indiscriminate, is
either an indication of unmitigated rusticity,
of shameless immorality, or is to be understood
as a joke,&mdash;very funny on its first
spontaneous utterance, but very flat if repeated.
Indulged in private, outside the
sacred boundaries of the family, between
men and women, it is unpardonable,&mdash;unatonable,
at least as far as the woman is
concerned. Good form requires that every
young lady shall be so well trained that she
will keep her lips absolutely untouched for
her husband, <i>after</i> the words have been
spoken that make him her husband.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>The &ldquo;betrothal kiss&rdquo; of the romancer has
been brought under suspicion in real life by
the fact that betrothal is, in our day, not by
any means equivalent to marriage; and the
young man who knows the world, and yet
sufficiently regards truth and purity to seek
them in a wife, would vastly prefer to find
his lady friend rigidly determined to keep
her lips to herself as long as they two are
yet twain, rather than to find them always at
even his command.</p>
<p>In the correspondence that has come to
me as a result of &ldquo;Studies in Home and
Child Life,&rdquo; is to be found pitiful evidence
of the ignorance in which young people are
allowed to grow up, even in a matter which
may seem, like this one, trivial and bordering
on the ridiculous.</p>
<p>The habit among children of kissing everybody
is little short of vicious. Kissing
games of every description are considered
vulgar, anywhere outside the immediate
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
family circle, and even then, because of the
trend of habit, they are not good form.</p>
<p>There is great possibility of infection in
the kiss. The remains of old teeth, the
breath and lips of those who are in any wise
diseased, make kissing dangerous. It is
well-nigh impossible to find a clean, sweet
mouth in these days of human degeneracy;
and because of these facts the little children
are exposed to every malignant disorder that
is afloat, and many that are hidden deep in
the foul cisterns of the broken-down body
of grandparents, father, mother, and the
strangers who straggle in and use their
&ldquo;rights&rdquo; on the freely rendered lips of the
little innocents.</p>
<p>The warnings of science, of which so many
make light, are timely, and should be religiously
regarded as the authority of God by
every one who does not know within himself
that he has so faithfully brought his whole
being into conformity with every law of life
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
and health that he is clean through and
through, so that the sensitive lips of his
babe can come to his with the same certainty
of a blessing in the caress that the bee has
when he goes to the white clover of the
meadow.</p>
<p>He, and he only, who has brought himself
fully into harmony with both the letter and
the spirit of Isaiah fifty-eight may freely
give his lips to his child, out of which to
drink his fill of love. And the home that is
brought into this beautiful accord with
Christ may be as the garden of the Lord,
from which all lips shall, with every caress,
gather that word of life that is sweeter than
honey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">X.</span></h2>
<p>The time is at hand when the truth must
be taken into every lane and walk of life&mdash;into
king&rsquo;s palaces, into halls of learning,
into banquet rooms, and into homes of refinement
and culture, as well as to the
haunts of poverty and crime; for the whole
earth must be filled with the knowledge of
the Lord. No soul must be left to arise in
the second resurrection and say, I did not
know the way of life, or I would not have
been here. There are being prepared in all
Christian homes those who shall become the
messengers of this gospel of the kingdom to
every rank, grade, and condition among
men.</p>
<p>This is a consideration for every Christian
mother and father. As among the children
of Israel every maiden held in her heart the
secret hope that she might be the mother of
the promised seed of David, so now, however
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
humble and far away from every center
of influence your home may be, however
meager its furnishing, however much you
may seem to lack incentive to noble effort,
there should be inspiration in the thought
that the little child playing about your feet,
whose life and habits you are molding, may
be one who shall be called to bear the
vessel of the Lord, which is his Word, filled
with the holy oil of his Spirit, before some
council of earth&rsquo;s great men, and to answer
for the principles by which the world is to
receive its final test.</p>
<p>By this I do not mean that he may be
called to suffer martyrdom,&mdash;although that
is possible&mdash;but I refer to the fact that he
may have the yet grander ministry of standing
up to be quizzed and catechized by those
learned in the wisdom of the world concerning
all that he has been taught of Christian
principle, health, disease, and life in the
Holy Ghost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Unquestionably, this work is waiting for
some select few of our young people in the
not far distant future. Some great council
of physicians will wish to know all about
what the medical missionary physicians
teach, and why; the chemists of the world
will wish to know the philosophy of the system
of dietetics which will keep the temple
of God in repair; and, as is almost always
the case among the people of the world,
there will be eating and drinking on a large
scale connected with all these investigations;
and your boy or girl may have to accept the
place as guest of honor at some such feast,
and carry himself <i>elegantly</i>, for Christ&rsquo;s sake
and the truth&rsquo;s; for the banquet, the dinner,
the lunch, play an important part in all
social affairs to-day, and will until the end
of probation.</p>
<p>If a man of means and social standing
becomes interested enough in what you know
of Christ to hear you out on it, he will make
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
you a dinner, invite a few friends, and give
you a chance to talk and tell all you know.
And if you know how to take advantage of
the opportunity&mdash;how to avoid giving offense
by your manner of speech and habits
of conduct; if you know how to charm and
win by your personality, you have placed at
the command of truth an instrument that
can be made effective where, otherwise, no
entrance could be gained.</p>
<p>Nowhere is the observance of good form
more necessary to one who has work to
do in the social world than at the table; for
here bad habits may be given such disgusting
publicity as to render them a cause of
reproach to any good cause; and the obligation
is upon every Christian home to see
that its children are so instructed that they
shall be ready to quickly fill any place to
which the work may call, and to stand with
dignity for the truth in any place that can
be opened to its consideration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>A home of wealth and elaborate appliances
is not necessary for such training. A child
who is instructed in the proper use of the
few simple things that constitute the furnishing
of the most humble home, and in those
rules of good form that ought to be the
natural order in any place, will not be left to
carry with him into some important convocation
careless table habits, which, under the
pressure of a sense of responsibility, would
certainly come to the front, in place of the few
better ways that he might have picked up and
stored away for occasional and special use.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;acting out just what is in him,&rdquo; he
will not bring himself and that which he
represents into ridicule; the opportunity of
giving the truth a chance to shine will not be
lost, while honest souls are left in the dark;
the breath of personal contempt will not
obscure the character of Christ, which he is
supposed to represent. He will be accepted,
first, because it is agreeable to look at him;
he will be heard because no good reason
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
appears why he should not be; and after
that, everything will depend on what he
really <i>is</i> and <i>has</i> down under the surface, in
the place where he lives alone with God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;the Lord, who calls a
man to stand in any place, will prevent any
disaster to the cause, provided his servant is
honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, God will be able to use even his
servants&rsquo; infirmities after he has &ldquo;<i>helped</i>&rdquo;
them (Rom. 8:26); <i>i. e.</i>, added to them his
strength and wisdom. And this which we
are considering is all in the nature of helps
to infirmity and ignorance. It is in the
direct line of legitimate education for the
very best Christian service.</p>
<p>The honest-hearted laborer for God, who,
with his heart full of love, starts out in his
ignorance and awkwardness to &ldquo;do something&rdquo;
for God and souls, will find &ldquo;something&rdquo;
to do; but we are now considering a
work which every man could not do, and
yet which some one must do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">XI.</span></h2>
<p>I must believe that the parents who fail,
from carelessness or from &ldquo;lack of ambition&rdquo;&mdash;the
holy sort, which is equivalent to
consecration and diligence&mdash;to give the child
the best possible preparation for a good
work, will be held responsible for the failure
that would have resulted if God had not
stepped in with some special helps and prevented
it.</p>
<p>Love for God will cover a multitude of
social sins; but those who are responsible
for the sins will sometime have their reproach
to bear. God does not like to have
to cover sins; he only does it so as to keep
things looking as tidy as possible, until they
can be put entirely out of the way. Covet
the best gifts for your child, give him the
best possible social habits, and then turn
him over to God for work, and God will
find rare service for him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>There are many teachings as to what constitutes
good form at table. It would be
impossible for the ordinary mortal so to
acquaint himself with them as to become a
&ldquo;social success;&rdquo; and this is far from our
purpose. All we need care about is to see
that the habits formed are free from anything
offensive. Society is kind to one who
is not ambitious for social distinction,&mdash;one
who has something to say that is worth
hearing, who represents a principle, or
some new thing the discussion of which may
possibly furnish an agreeable diversion,&mdash;very
much after the manner of the Athenians
in Paul&rsquo;s time; so that even if one does not
&ldquo;know all the ropes,&rdquo; like one &ldquo;to the
Manor born,&rdquo; he will be received and heard,
provided he does not blunder into the few
things which good form has decreed that he
must not do under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Among these prohibited things are thrusting
out the elbows from the side so as to
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
push his neighbor at table; resting the
elbows on the table; and extending the legs
under it so as to bring the feet in the way of
those belonging to the guest opposite. If
any guest does these things, he may be sure
that there will be at least three people over
whom the best and truest things that he can
say will have very little influence.</p>
<p>The eyes of those who chance to glance
his way will be seriously offended and quickly
averted if he should take up even a half-slice
of bread and bite into it. Good form says
that bread must be broken off in small bits,
just when needed, not spread, but with a
small lump of butter placed upon it (provided
one uses butter), conveyed to the
mouth with the thumb and finger of the left
hand. You will be permitted to bite the
piece in two once if you wish, but no more;
that is, it must not be more than two
&ldquo;mouthfuls&rdquo; to begin with. Under no circumstances
must anything, such as fruit-pits,
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
etc., be ejected from the mouth into a spoon,
fork, or plate, but taken from the lips with
the left thumb and finger, and placed on the
plate. Neither bread nor any refuse is ever
to be placed on the cloth, but on the side-dishes
provided; or, lacking these, on the
one plate that is being used.</p>
<p>Food should not be conveyed to the mouth
with a knife, but with a fork, always excepting
soup, and such sauce as must be handled
with a spoon.</p>
<p>Do teach your children not to thrust the
point of the spoon into the mouth, but to
take its contents with the lips from that part
nearest the handle, without the least possible
sound. Teach them not to lift the spoon so
full that it will drip; and as your boy grows
up into mustaches he will need to learn how
to take soup and sauce without defiling those
manly ornaments, or else to let soup alone at
the banquet. But you can teach him from
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
childhood to handle his napkin so deftly as
to keep his lips clean, even after they have
put on their thatch.</p>
<p>As to the napkin, by all means habituate
the child to its use, even if it be nothing
more than a square of old calico or flour-sacking,
hemmed, or even <i>un</i>hemmed. He
can learn on a piece of his mother&rsquo;s old
apron how to use the fine linen of the king&rsquo;s
banquet-hall, and do it so daintily that the
apron and the mother who wore it down to
napkin dimensions will confer honor on the
king&rsquo;s damask.</p>
<p>O my sister mothers in the many humbler
homes of those who love our Lord and are
looking for his appearing, has it seemed to
you that any of these things that I have
written are trivial or burdensome, wholly
outside the sphere of life in which you and
your children will ever move? Are you so
overburdened with many cares that you feel,
when the food is cooked and placed &ldquo;anyhow,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
that your part is done; that the family
may come &ldquo;just as it happens&rdquo; and eat,
simply to satisfy hunger, as do the cattle in
the field? Have you thought that if you
could but get through the day anyhow, your
duty was done? Still you must meet the
<i>certainties</i> that are before you. Your children
must bear a part in the closing scenes
of the world&rsquo;s history,&mdash;ask yourself if there
is not something for you in these things that
I have written. They have been written with
a most solemn sense of their importance.
<i>They are a part of the gospel message</i>; they
concern the work which some one now in
training must do before the Lord can come.</p>
<p>The knowledge of how to prepare and
serve a hygienic dinner, as well as how to
select suitable portions and decline others,
at a worldly banquet, may be absolutely
necessary to the winning of souls in the last
call to the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">XII.</span></h2>
<p>Nothing is of more importance to success
in any work than conversation. How to
converse so as to win and not wound, to
both give and gain, is an accomplishment
which has very nearly passed into the list of
lost arts. And here again good form comes
to the rescue, and by its placid but arbitrary
code offsets that lawlessness into which
even good men have fallen in excess of zeal.</p>
<p>Sixty years ago the rule for children was
that they &ldquo;should be seen and not heard,&rdquo;
so that a child&rsquo;s talk was almost unknown in
a company of adults. This was so wrong
that it has reacted in a sort of wild freedom
upon the part of the children which, uncorrected,
develops into the adult chatter-box
and gossip, than which no character is more
to be dreaded.</p>
<p>Bad habits of conversation are very hard
to break, and since it is by the &ldquo;calves (or
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
sacrifice) of the lips&rdquo; that we are especially
to honor God, by &ldquo;words fitly spoken,&rdquo;
and that we are to &ldquo;give a reason for the
faith that is in us,&rdquo; it is not of small importance
that we should know how to talk.
Begin with the baby, therefore, so that the
child shall grow up into correct forms of
speech, and into that regard of all good form
which shall not only give him at once the
ears, but the hearts of the people.</p>
<p>I scarcely need to say, Do not use slang,
for this is universally understood as out of
harmony with Christian practise; but yet it
may not be amiss to say that even the world
of society, whose laws of behavior we are
considering, would ostracize one whose language
was punctuated with much slang. An
<i>oath</i> would be more tolerable to so-called
&ldquo;polite ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Money, or prominence, will for a time give
a man social passport in spite of all manner
of ill-breeding. He can <i>buy</i> a place and
recognition even from those who despise
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
him; but this is not the sort of recognition in
the interests of which I am writing. I am
pleading for that which shall gain a hearing
for the custodians of a truth without which
no man can live, and for the reception of
which few are as yet prepared. It is for the
sake of the honest souls who are in the darkness
of the world&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>culture</i>&rdquo; that I am
pleading. They have a right to know all
that the Spirit of God has been sending to
his people concerning that all-round righteousness
that makes up the sum of that <i>whole
gospel for the whole man</i>, which is included
in an uttermost salvation; and some tongues
must be so cultured as to talk the way open
for truth just as effectually as a <i>wag</i> can do
it for <i>fun</i>, a singer open it for a song, or
money open it for blind boorishness; and
the quiet mother in the home must have a
large share of this work.</p>
<p>To this end teach the child that he must
<i>listen</i> when any other child is speaking until
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
he has finished; never to interrupt, or, if it
is necessary to give some information, to say,
for instance: &ldquo;I beg your pardon, but,&mdash;&rdquo;
or, &ldquo;Willie, if you please, was it not on
Wednesday instead of Tuesday?&rdquo; Any interruption
simply for getting in a word
should never be indulged. Teach him to
wait patiently for a fair chance to speak, no
matter how great may be the temptation to
&ldquo;thrust in his oar.&rdquo; This should not be
construed to include those playful interruptions
in the merry tangle of words which all
children delight in &ldquo;once in a while,&rdquo; &ldquo;just
for fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Teach him to avoid all abrupt forms of
expression, such as &ldquo;Give me that!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; &ldquo;Quit!&rdquo; &ldquo;Get out!&rdquo;
&ldquo;You sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t!&rdquo; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; If he never
hears such phrases at home, he will not be
apt to catch them; but if he should, a few
little experiences such as he would certainly
meet as a man upon entering the social
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
world, with the adult equivalents of these
words, would teach him that they were very
unprofitable. Let him find out that he can
get nothing in that way, and he will begin
intuitively to cultivate his tongue to acceptable
speech.</p>
<p>It is not good form to talk at table about
the physical organs, or the processes of
digestion, excepting when some special occasion
should require, and then it should be
by the most delicate allusions. The mention
of any form of disease, or of death,
would be considered exceeding bad form;
also any malodorous topic of any sort.
Table conversation should be such as to inspire
every good feeling; appetizing, promotive
of good fellowship, comradeship,
faith, hope; optimistic in every sense of
the word. The children should be taught
that no complaints or grievances are to be
mentioned there, because such things always
have a tendency to destroy relish for food,
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
and retard the process of digestion. A
chronic grumbler at the table will threaten a
whole family with dyspepsia. &ldquo;Let your
conversation be seasoned with salt,&rdquo; is a
good injunction; and if the Scriptural rule
is followed at home, the child will grow up
capable of taking the gospel message anywhere
without personal offense, even if he
must go into many untried places. Neither
will it be necessary for him to &ldquo;premeditate;
but whatsoever shall be given ... in
that hour&rdquo; (Mark 13:11) he shall be able
to speak.</p>
<p>I have confined myself to the <i>Form</i>,&mdash;a
form which, though good, is dead,&mdash;the <i>letter</i>
of the social code, which is at best a lifeless
thing, a burden, a barrier, often a cause of
heart-burning jealousy, wrath, anger, adulteries,
and every sort of contention. There is
nothing so cruel as a quarrel carried on
under the cloak of good form. The bitter
sarcasm of a war waged with polite words
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
and phrases, the tones keyed to simulate
tenderness and love, as society requires,
but breathing of hate, makes a combination
in which Satan is especially manifested as
in nothing else in the world. Truly the
letter killeth. The social code is all right,
but, lacking the Spirit, it is a rotting carcass.
However, since it was modeled after
Christ, it requires but that the Holy Spirit
shall breathe life into it to make it an instrument
for the accomplishment of necessary
work in carrying the gospel to every creature.</p>
<p>It is manifestly better to be filled with the
Spirit than covered with all the forms in the
world; but <i>good form</i>, vitalized, will make
any messenger so ready for any good work
in any field that he need take no thought
how or what he shall speak, for it shall be
given him the same hour. &ldquo;For it is not
ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father
which speaketh in you.&rdquo; Matt. 10:20.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">XIII.</span></h2>
<p>Even good form may be made too burdensome
to be endured, and it is the privilege
of conscientious Christian society to
strike the happy medium between this oppressive
formalism and the true kindly life
which can cause even the violation of all
form to be almost unnoticed.</p>
<p>It is better to have the good life without
the good form than to have the good form
without the good life; but it is our privilege,
and duty as well, to have both.</p>
<p>In treating upon this subject it must not
be forgotten that there are forms and forms.
Each city aims to be a center of social good
form for itself and its suburbs. Each has
its own little peculiarities, as, for instance,
its own manner of using visiting cards,&mdash;the
size, shape, turning of the corners this
way and that as signals; all of which differ
according to the decree of the social leaders
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
of a great center of social influence; and
yet the manners of one city would never be
considered blunders in any other, however
much they might differ, provided they were
sincere, easy, adjustable, and dainty. It is
not, however, considered elegant to ignore
the customs of the people among whom you
may visit. That which your hostess considers
good form should be good to you
while you are her guest, unless some principle
is violated. Good form requires concessions
to even ignorance without any of
the &ldquo;I-am-more-cultured-than-you&rdquo; air.</p>
<p>Because of this diversity of forms it will
be manifestly impossible for any one to know
just what would be considered good form in
every detail the world over. As in everything
else which involves principles and
their application, it is true in this, that if
you know and appreciate the opportunities,
and keep your eyes open, you will be able
to avoid serious mistakes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>In reply to many questions of a miscellaneous
character I bind a little sheaf of
gleanings with which to conclude this subject
of good form.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When a gentleman friend of the family
calls, is it proper for the wife to go on with
her work, and not go to the parlor at all to
welcome him, but to leave him to be entirely
entertained by the husband? Or is it necessary
that she go to the parlor, and remain
during his visit? Would it be proper for
her to leave the room during his visit without
asking to be excused?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all I wish to drop the remark that
the word &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; is not good form, as
commonly used. It has been so perverted
and misused that it does not in these days
even mean that for which it was first intended,&mdash;a
man of especially good manners.
There are &ldquo;gentlemen of <i>the cloth</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;gentlemen
of <i>the turf</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;the gentleman of <i>the
road</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;the gentleman <i>about town</i>;&rdquo;&mdash;all
slang phrases, which have brought the word
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
into disrepute. The compound word &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo;
was an effort upon the part of human
society to make distinctions which the
Creator had refused to recognize. He
called man &ldquo;<span class="smaller">MAN</span>.&rdquo; One can not be <i>more</i>
than a man. Furthermore, the appropriation
of the word &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; by the &ldquo;aristocracy,&rdquo;
the fact that in the social world
there is a &ldquo;gentleman class,&rdquo; has made the
expression inappropriate for universal application.
Instead of speaking of your
gentleman friend, speak of your man friend.</p>
<p>Therefore I will say in reply to my questioner
that when a man friend calls upon the
husband and family it is proper for the wife
to occupy herself with some work kept at
hand for such occasions; or, if necessary,
after she has greeted him, and passed a few
minutes pleasantly in conversation, she may
excuse herself, and go to her household
duties; but if she can do so, it is very
cordial, and in every respect good form, for
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
her to take her work, and with some graceful
word of apology, such as any man would
appreciate, go on keeping her hands busy,
while she assists in entertaining her husband&rsquo;s
friend. In leaving the room she should ask
to be excused, unless the men are so occupied
as to make it an interruption to do
so. If she does not expect to return, however,
she should make her adieus, and invite
him to call again, before leaving the parlor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Is it admissible for a lady to keep on
with her sewing or mending while she is
entertaining a caller? Can she take some
kind of fancy work with her while she is
visiting a friend or neighbor?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is perfectly admissible for a woman to
keep on with her sewing and mending while
she is entertaining a caller, provided she
speaks of it in some simple, graceful fashion.
This is a much better means of manifesting
your appreciation of a caller than to lay
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
aside necessary work and take some fancy
article. You can even take your mending
with you while visiting a friend and neighbor,
and it will be appreciated more than
fancy work. In many localities fancy work,
especially for married women, has fallen
into disfavor among even society people.
There is a social cult which makes much of
everything practical. It is a fad;&mdash;here to-day,
gone to-morrow; but it has prepared
the way for even a stocking-bag in the
boudoir of some social queen: the stockings,
of course, are supposed to be of the
very finest texture and quality, and the
darning in itself to be a piece of finest lace
work; and yet under the cover of this supposition
one can take a real serviceable hose
and do good, practical work upon it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Should the hostess offer to take the hat
of a gentleman caller? and where should
she place it?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>If he does not at once make his hat
at home, she should indicate where he
can leave it. It is better form for her to
suggest that he can hang it upon the hat
rack or peg in the hall, or lay it on the
table, if he does not seem to know that he
can do so, than it would be to take it from
him. If he has been properly instructed, as
every boy should be at home, he will, without
any effort upon her part, relieve her of
the necessity of looking after his hat. But
if he appears embarrassed by it, take it at
once with some pleasant remark calculated
to set him at ease, and place it where it
ought to be. The proper place is in the
hall, if there be a hall. Lacking this, any
convenient place is in order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If a man friend happens to call when
the husband is absent and the wife alone,
should she invite him into the parlor and
visit with him?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Such a friend should so time his visits
as to make reasonably sure that the man
of the house would be at home, but if
he fails to do so, it is the better way to
inform him when the husband will return,
and invite him to call again, provided this
would be agreeable to both husband and
wife. It is, however, bad form to say,
&ldquo;Come again,&rdquo; when you mean, &ldquo;Stay
away;&rdquo; <i>very</i> bad form for the wife to invite
any one to call who would necessarily be
disagreeable to the man of the house. In
these days of moral contamination and
prevalent gossip, good form is a conservator
of good morals. Even as regards the wife&rsquo;s
relation to her pastor, if the husband is not a
Christian, and, as often happens, dislikes
ministers as a class, and makes a call anything
but pleasant, common politeness requires
that all pastoral visits shall include
the husband.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Where several are invited to a dinner, is
it necessary for the men to escort the ladies
to the table? or is it better for each to walk
out independently?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In relation to dinner manners, the hostess
is expected to decide all forms for her company.
If she wishes to make it very formal,
she arranges just what man shall take out
a certain woman. The couples will be so
seated that a man and a woman will occupy
alternate places. Every woman is expected
to entertain first her own escort, and
then to assist in entertaining the one who
sits next her on the other side, and also occasionally
to exchange a word with the one
who sits opposite. It is not, however, expected
that one will talk all over the table,
nor that any one voice will command general
attention until the table is cleared, and
the after-dinner program is called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If two gentlemen with their wives should
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
be riding in one carriage, would it be proper
for the husband and wife to be separated,
and each gentleman sit with the other man&rsquo;s
wife?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If married couples are riding together the
most graceful thing is for the host and hostess
to take a guest to entertain; either for
the two men and the two women to sit together,
or for the couples to exchange
companions. It would be an exceedingly
ungracious act for the host and hostess to
sit together during the ride, thus leaving
their guests to each other alone. In any
country good form requires that husbands
and wives should appreciate each other
enough to consider that they are conferring
a favor by giving others an opportunity
to enjoy their society; and that they should
at least <i>seem</i> to trust each other to be
friendly to other men and women, even if
they quarrel about it when they are alone.
The appearance of suspicion is the most foul
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
of all bad forms; it is, in fact, the very
stench from the body of moral death.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Is it proper for a woman to call in company
with her husband upon a man who
lives alone?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it proper for a lady to visit a sick
man who is not a relative?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is suitable for a woman to accompany
her husband <i>anywhere</i>. If the husband intends
calling on a man who lives alone, it is
a very neighborly act for his wife to accompany
him. A feminine presence might
brighten the home of a social hermit, and
would surely be as a benediction to him if
he were an invalid, or in trouble.</p>
<p>In visiting a sick man it would be better
for two ladies to go together, provided no
interested man friend or nurse could accompany
them. Yet there might be cases where
it would be necessary, and the only Christian
thing, for a woman to call alone, if she
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
must, and render any necessary care. This
should, however, be only in case of necessity.
The general rule should be observed
as far as possible, that men should care for
men, and women for women.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When leaving a reception, dinner, or
any private entertainment, should one bid
the hostess good night first before addressing
the others? Or, if there are several
ladies belonging to the house, would it be
best to address the eldest lady first? I suppose
it would be the same when entering the
house. I would like to know what the rules
are in regard to this, if there are any.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hostess takes precedence of all other
members of the household for the time
being. If a person is required by circumstances
to take an early leave, and the hostess,
as is sometimes the case, be occupied,
it is admissible to address others first.
Faultless manners require that if possible
your personal arrangements should be such
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
that you can accommodate yourself to whatever
exigencies may arise, so that without
any stress or pressure of any sort, you can
have time to wait for an opportunity to
speak first to the hostess, and announce that
you are taking your leave. Then the way
is open for any informal leave-taking and
preparations which you may have to make,
reserving the last word for the host, at the
door, unless indeed, as sometimes happens,
he stands beside his wife at the leave-taking
as well as the reception.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Should the host offer to entertain the
company himself with music, or should the
visitors invite him to entertain them?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This depends upon the kind of entertainment,
the character of his visitors, and the
proficiency of the host as a musician. If
he is really a musician, and has something
which he knows would give pleasure to the
company, it would be expected that he
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
would favor them. A few words of introduction,
not of himself, but of the music,
would be appropriate; but it should be
done in the most informal and unobtrusive
manner possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Should one recognize and bow to an

so, is it necessary to recognize him and bow
again? How should a lady do at the second
meeting?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In chancing to look up and recognize a
familiar friend upon the opposite side of the
street, a slight inclination of the head on the
part of a woman is correct; on the part of a
man or boy, touching or lifting the hat; but
a vocal greeting at that distance would be
bad form. It is not necessary to bow every
time you meet in passing and repassing often
during the day, although some sign of recognition
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
is always good; but when upon the
first meeting during the day proper greetings
have been duly exchanged, a slight
inclination of the head, a touch of the hat,
a cordial glance is sufficient. More could
be made very tiresome if you were to meet
often while about the day&rsquo;s business.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Is it good form to use a toothpick at
the table?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is bad form to use a toothpick in any
but the most private manner. Its public
appearance is always repulsive. It should
never be used as an article of table decoration.
It is one of those necessary articles
that can never be suggestive of anything
appetizing or graceful; in fact, its suggestions
are wholly of things concerning which
one should be as reticent and retired as
possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Which is the better form,&mdash;to use the

the left hand, and use the knife to push the
food upon it? In short, in which hand
should the fork properly be held, and what
is the office of the knife at the table?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fork should always be used in the
right hand, for cutting, taking up, and conveying
food to the mouth, unless one is left-handed.
In that case it should be used in
the left hand. The knife should only be
used for cutting what can not be cut with
the fork, and when not in use, should lie on
the plate. It has a very limited service at
the table. It would be very awkward to use
the knife to push food on to the fork, because
it is entirely unnecessary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Should brothers and sisters call upon
each other in their sleeping-rooms in connection
with boarding-schools?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those who are old enough to go away to
boarding-school should come under the same
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
regulations in such matters as any other men
and women must observe. The bedroom is
not designed as a reception-room. It has
properly only one use. If it must for any
reason be used as a study-room, yet the fact
that it is a bedroom makes it unfit for a visiting
place. It is furthermore the usual rule
for two persons to occupy the same room in
the school home, and manifestly immodest
for sister or brother to intrude upon the
privacy of these roommates. Besides these
considerations the association of brothers
and sisters should be upon the same plane of
modest deportment as between any other
man and woman. This should be taught
the children in the home, and practised
everywhere, for the purpose of education and
training preparatory to meeting the conditions
which exist in the world at large.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under what circumstances is it proper
for young men and women to correspond
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
with each other? Where not allowable, give
reasons.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a thorough acquaintance between a
young man and woman has developed into
that association which points to marriage,
and when they must necessarily be separated,
correspondence is right. Such correspondence
should not, however, be considered
too sacred to share with father and mother.
Anything that can not be shared with a good
parent is dangerous.</p>
<p>If there is good reason for confidence between
the young people who are drawn toward
each other, and yet who have had no
good opportunity to become thoroughly acquainted,
a correspondence for the purpose
of acquaintance is admissible, although not
wholly safe. To correspond with more than
one at a time has every appearance of evil,
and is too often just as evil as it can appear
to be. Correspondence, excepting as it
leads up to marriage, should be for business
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
only, as brief and formal as possible, and
should stop short when its purpose has been
served. A <i>religious</i> correspondence between
young men and women is one of Satan&rsquo;s
most fruitful and profane devices.</p>

and public to all at all times. In such an
apartment young ladies in school should be
able to receive calls, under proper chaperonage
and advice from those who have them
in charge. Promiscuous calling would be
bad form, and dangerous to reputation.</p>

<p>The only way in which they can do missionary

work for each other is in each one making

good manners, according to the divine model,
and then leave the detail work for young

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Is it proper for a company of young

<p>This would depend on the character of
the company. One chaperon would not be
sufficient for a company of young men
and young women. There should be
<i>chaperons</i>,&mdash;a man for the young men,
and a woman for the young women; and if
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
the company is large, there should be a sufficient
number of elderly companions to give
them all necessary protection and support in
the enjoyment of the occasion. There could
be no reason why a select party of young
people, properly accompanied, should not
enjoy an outing of this description. But in
such a case it would be not only bad form,
but criminal, for any young man or woman
to take advantage of the occasion to break
over any of the protective regulations upon
which all should agree before starting out.
Common politeness and good sense would

<p>Neither. To take the slightest notice of

the advantage. At such a time as this rudeness
would not be good form. The only
safe course would be to ignore him as you
would the buzz of the locust in the tree, or
the sound of the cable along the track of the
car line. You are obliged to be conscious of
its presence, but you go on your way, just
the same, and let it buzz or roar. Whatever
such a fellow may say or do, never turn
your eyes one hair&rsquo;s breadth. Allow him
to wonder if you are really blind and deaf.
A word or act of even protest would give
him a chance to reply. One word would
call for another, and no one could possibly

may be impure, but they may be
really only the result of wrong methods and
circumstances over which the child has no
control, and for which he is not at all responsible.
In manner and habit he may be vile,
and yet be no more responsible as far as
thought and motive is concerned than he
would be for having the measles. He has
simply been exposed, caught it, and needs
to be cured. But whatever the thought and
inner life may be, if his language and

the parent has greatly the advantage, as he
alone is capable of understanding the secrets
which may be locked away, in the breast of
the child, from any possible discovery by
the teacher. The responsibility of parents,
however, never ends, while that of the
teacher is limited to the hours in the school,

<p>The above questions can all be answered

acknowledging invitations to receptions differs
as widely as the style of cards; but the
very best &ldquo;good form&rdquo; is for each invited

<p>Concerning weddings: in many circles it
is supposed that a response to a wedding
invitation must necessarily include a wedding
gift; but to assume that such an event
is the occasion of soliciting silverware, dry-goods,
and furniture is one of the very worst
of all bad forms. The wedding gift has become
one of the most troublesome expressions
of social hypocrisy. If it could be
possible to abolish it, and give society a
chance to go back to the simple habits of
fifty years ago, it would be a blessing indeed.
It is a misfortune to a young couple
to receive even one gift that either for its
pretended or real value would make the simple

obliged to begin life seem mean. Flowers
or books are the most suitable things to
bring to a wedding, and even flowers may

of whom he will have no reason to be
ashamed.</p>
<p>Good form requires that the introduction
of any two persons should be by the desire
of both. The slightest objection upon the
part of either would make the introduction
a gross intrusion. The reasons for this are
obvious. Society has seen that after the
introduction, anything may follow, and the
only chance for a young woman to protect
herself from undesirable and dangerous association,
may be in the rigid enforcement of
this simple rule of rights. The proper form
of introduction is that which is most easy
and graceful in manner for the one who is
to do the introducing. As in everything
else, individuality should be given a chance;
the spirit and manner carries much more
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
weight than the words. Always, however,
the person who is to be in any way advantaged
by the introduction, favored either in
pleasure or profit, is the one who is to be
presented to the other. For instance, Mr.
Lane has seen Miss Mason, and has recognized
her as one whose acquaintance he
would enjoy. He asks a mutual friend to
secure the privilege of this introduction;
Miss Mason has been asked the favor with
the assumption that it will be entirely for
Mr. Lane&rsquo;s advantage and pleasure. Miss
Mason is gracious, and consents to grant
the request. Mr. Lane is therefore brought
to the place where the young lady is waiting.
Never should a person who is to receive
another be asked to come to be introduced.
Bring the candidate for this social
favor, to the one of whom it has been asked,
and upon approaching, you will say, &ldquo;Miss
Mason, allow me the pleasure of presenting
Mr. Lane. Mr. Lane, Miss Mason,&rdquo; upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
which Miss Mason will bow slightly, Mr.
Lane a little more noticeably. They will
not shake hands, but will stand, or perhaps
be seated, and converse for a few moments,
when Mr. Lane will take his leave, if he
knows what is good for him, and wait for
some further recognition from Miss Mason.</p>
<p>Among very intimate friends, where it is
well known that an acquaintance would
certainly be a mutual pleasure and benefit,
this formula is not always necessary. I have
been giving the strict social good-form code,
which is for protection against annoyances.
It would be an unfortunate social misdemeanor
for any person to make the second
effort to receive an introduction which has
been once declined, without some advances
from the person who had made the refusal.</p>
<p>When a young man desires to cultivate
the acquaintance of a young woman, good
form requires that before he utters a word,
he shall frankly inform her parents of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
wishes, and ask their consent. <i>And this is
right</i>; and even if their decision is against
him, a young man who is worthy of a wife
will have that regard for the rights of the
parent which will make him careful how
he ruthlessly breaks into the family circle.
He will give himself time and opportunity
to win the parents, before he disturbs the
mind of the daughter. The observance of
good form in such matters will bring a
blessing, and save unspeakable trouble, even
if it should require what seems to the heart
of a youth a great deal of unreasonable
delay.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;After the introduction should the mutual
friend leave, or remain and lead out in
conversation?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the introduction the newly made
acquaintances may or may not be left to
their own devices in following up the introduction.
This introduction does not under
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
any circumstances bind the young woman to
any future recognition of the person who
has been introduced to her. She may ruthlessly
ignore him the next time she meets
him without any violation of good form, it
being supposed that she has sufficient reason
for doing so, and he will have no occasion
to complain. He must accept the fact that
he has had all that he can receive of pleasure
or profit from this acquaintance, and be
satisfied with it, unless he can by some
means so bring himself in some manly way
to the notice of this young woman that
she shall indicate her wish to continue the
acquaintance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What is good form in dress for an evening
reception for both men and women?
Should gloves be worn?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a formal reception, society requires
that a man should wear black. If the host
wears gloves, the men should do so. If the
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
hostess only wears gloves, only the women
wear gloves. At a wedding the bride determines
whether gloves shall be worn. It
would be very bad form to wear gloves if
the bride&rsquo;s hands were bare. The fashion
changes with reference to what is suitable
for both men and women, but as a rule what
is known as the cutaway coat for men, with
a white necktie, makes an evening dress for
any occasion. It need not necessarily be of
expensive material. A great variety is admissible
in women&rsquo;s costume at a reception.
If she chooses to wear her bonnet, she may
also wear a simple tailor-made gown, of
very plain style and color, a traveling dress,
or even an ordinary street dress; or she may
be arrayed like the veriest butterfly in all the
colors of the rainbow, and still preserve unbroken
the rules of good form in dress according
to the social code. But the plainer
style is unquestionably the better form in
every sense of the word. This is a social
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
concession to the conscientious Christian
element in social life, and an effort to retain
it; and the more truly people carry conscience
into dress, as well as the more they
cultivate every true Christian grace, the
more they are appreciated even by those
who give time and thought to what seems to
be frivolous in custom and costume.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;How shall one cultivate the art of conversation?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all <i>by conversing</i>. But to talk one
must <i>know</i> and <i>think</i>. Select some theme of
general interest and importance, inform
yourself concerning it, then train your mind
to methodical handling of it; think it over
in colloquial form; talk about it to the home
folks, study the dictionary for a vocabulary,
and use what you find. It is a good thing
to have several words at your tongue&rsquo;s end
which mean the same thing, or nearly so;
but it is very bad form to &ldquo;talk <i>book</i>.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
You can fill yourself with the book, but
when it comes to expressing yourself in conversation,
talk <i>talk</i>,&mdash;common language, pure
and simple, short words such as even a child
can understand.</p>
<p>The best conversationalist is one who by
saying but little himself (that little choice,
clear, and true) can draw others out to a
free expression of their thoughts, making
even the slow and stammering to feel &ldquo;at
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is bad form to take advantage of a social
opportunity to air any private opinions
that must necessarily arouse opposition and
controversy. Conversation should be like a
refreshing stream, holding all truth in solution
in such form that it shall be recognized
as sweet waters, at which the thirsty soul
may find refreshment. The truth which it
contains can be trusted to do its work in
thought and life, as the iron and magnesia
may on blood and tissue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What is the difference between good
form, etiquette, and ethics?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good form contains the bare principle,
etiquette applies the principle, and ethics
brings <i>conscience</i> into the practise of it. It
is possible for etiquette to violate every
principle of both good form and ethics;
but good form and ethics will always agree
when they understand each other, and will
make a safe environment in which any child,
youth, man, or woman may live, love, and
labor.</p>
<p>Nowhere is the observance of good form
more necessary than during a journey. It
is especially a safeguard to the young and inexperienced
against the designing and vicious.</p>
<p>The rule is that the traveling dress should
be of the most unobtrusive character, of
some neutral color, with no showy embellishments
on hat or gown, something which
can be readily shaken or brushed free of
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
dust; and that every movement should be
such as to avoid attracting attention; that no
acquaintance should be formed with strangers,
unless it be under circumstances that
could admit of no possible question.</p>
<p>It is bad form to stand and look about in
a waiting-room, or to promenade the platform,
to turn the head and gaze at people,
or to ask questions of any but officials.
These things, trivial as they may seem, carefully
observed, help to keep a hedge of
safety about the young woman or boy who
is obliged to travel alone, while only a slight
departure from these rules will often open
the way for annoyance, and even dangers
such as we can not discuss in these pages.</p>
<p>In the matter of asking questions, the
prospective traveler should inform herself
concerning everything she will need to know
of her route, etc., as thoroughly as possible,
before she starts, so as to make questioning
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
unnecessary. It is dangerous to depend
even upon men in uniform for information
beyond certain narrow limits. Do not expect
a local ticket agent, nor yet a railroad
conductor, brakeman, or Pullman car porter
to know what every passenger may need to
know in order to reach his destination.</p>
<p>The man in uniform is responsible for
knowing one or two things and seeing that
his own end of the work is kept well in hand.
Beyond that he has no official responsibility,
and is often as likely to abuse confidence, and
betray trusting ignorance, as any other man.</p>
<p>If you are a young girl traveling alone,
compelled to make a transfer across the
city, <i>never</i> take a carriage or cab, but the
common public omnibus. If you have a
tedious wait before you, do not try to relieve
it by sauntering about the depot or
street, or any public places. Settle yourself
down with determination to patiently and
quietly endure <i>in the depot</i>, unless you know
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
some suitable place to which you can go
and spend the time. Do not ask, receive,
or act upon any advice from <i>any</i> strangers
as to hotels, or any other places where you
could spend the hours more comfortably.
Accept no invitations excepting from well-known
friends, and even then not to any ice-cream
parlors or restaurants. Nothing
short of a <i>family</i> invitation to some good
home should turn you for a moment from
your purpose to keep closely to the line of
travel, and endure hardness with good practical
common sense.</p>
<p>Children should be taught in the regular
routine of home life how to entertain and
how to be entertained; how to avoid the
necessity of putting on &ldquo;company manners&rdquo;
by always in all relations of life observing
those principles of politeness which
are summed up in the gospel as expressed in
that law of liberty known as the Golden
Rule.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>As a hostess, do not overload your guest
with attention. Nothing is more wearisome
than to be compelled to ward off continual
intrusive efforts to make you happy and
comfortable as a guest. See that all necessary
provision is made for your guest before
arrival, that water for drinking and bathing,
with glasses and towels, are in her room in
readiness. Take your guest at once to the
room appointed without stopping for introductions
or greetings; inquire if anything
further is needed; state the hour of meals,
and any other regulations which must in any
manner concern a transient member of your
household; arrange to return in a half-hour
to lead the way to the family room for
greetings and introductions, and then withdraw,
leaving the coast clear for such attention
to personal comfort as is always needed
even after a short journey.</p>
<p>There may be degrees of intimacy that
would seem to naturally modify these good-form
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
requirements, but it would be perfectly
safe to hold yourself to them, even if the
guest were your own mother, sister, or
brother. If your guest is to make a long
visit, everything like <i>effort</i> to secure his
comfort should be kept out of sight. In
fact, all arrangements should be made so as
to make the visit a pleasure to all concerned;
and this can only be done by taking him
into the home life, and going on just the
same in everything as if you were alone as
a family.</p>
<p>An invitation to a friend to visit you
should be for a definite time, and should
not upon any account be extended unless
you <i>heartily</i> desire it. Not a word or hint
should be dropped out of so-called politeness,
which, if taken literally, would stay
his departure one hour after the time limit
has been reached. The sort of hypocrisy
that would say, &ldquo;O don&rsquo;t hurry off just
yet,&rdquo; when you feel in your heart that you
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
can not conveniently have the visit prolonged,
is very bad form, indeed, and a
grievous wrong to your friend.</p>
<p>As a guest, one should at once fall into
the regular order of the family life as nearly
as it is possible to do so, avoiding everything
that would add to labor for hostess or
servants.</p>
<p>A guest should give no orders to children
or servants. All requests should be made
of host or hostess, and left for them to pass
on as they shall see fit. Good form requires
that the guest shall be blind and deaf
to any unpleasant episodes that may occur,
taking no part in any disputes from the
children up, and that at any moment when
his presence could prove an embarrassment,
he will find it necessary to retire to his
room, take a stroll in the wood or field, or a
&ldquo;day off&rdquo; in town; and then when the time
limit for which his visit was planned has
been reached, he will take his departure, no
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
matter how warmly he may be urged &ldquo;not
to hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Give neither money nor eatables to the
children. Make no plans which include
them without first consulting host and hostess.
In fact, the guest should propose
nothing, plan nothing. This should all be
left to host and hostess. He should make
of his presence a pleasure to all, which will
leave nothing more to be desired. Let him
find his place in the domestic economy for
the time being, and fill it in just as helpful
a manner as possible, remembering that here
it is as true as it can be anywhere in the
world, that he who abases himself shall be
exalted, and he who seeks the most for others,
finds the most for himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">XIV.</span></h2>
<p>For public teachers, and especially those
who are in preparation for such work, this
little book has a special message. The
world will not suffer long nor be kind to any
exponent of truth who offends in platform
etiquette, or in home courtesy. Accordingly,
I would urge my young fellow laborers to
eschew everything in manner which could
produce dislike or disgust in the most critical,
for that most critical may be the very
soul to whom you are sent.</p>
<p>As brethren in council together, cultivate
only those things that can be used anywhere
in an uncharitable world. Do not allow
anything to become habitual that will call
attention to any part of the body or clothing.
Never finger the watch guard, coat buttons,
nor the features of the face. Unfortunate
practices of this nature have nullified the
effect of many a sermon. Many a young
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
man has made a farce of his testimony for
Christ because he stood twirling his mustache;
and many a Sabbath-school teacher
has failed to hold her pupils to the truth because
her hat was filled with nodding plumes,
flowers, or an elaborate tangle of ribbon.</p>
<p>Good form insists that any Sabbath display
is vulgar, so that the woman of genuine
social position will leave the elaborate church
toilet to her servants, while she goes in the
plainest of modest apparel to the house
of God.</p>
<p>One great misfortune to both home and
church is that good form has been considered
a sort of parade dress, to be laid off with the
&ldquo;company&rdquo; clothes. The home folks have
been compelled to tolerate anything from
each other, upon the supposition that nothing
matters at home; when the fact is that
<i>there</i> everything in dress and conversation
matters more than in any other spot on
earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>The home dress should be such as would
be respectable if the wearer were called out
by some emergency, with no time to change.</p>
<p>Good form condemns the &ldquo;Mother Hubbard,&rdquo;
and with good reason: Its origin was
infamous, its suggestions are such that the
woman who wears it can not command the
same respect from even her own family as
though she were clothed with a modest
garment.</p>
<p>Society can and will reject the presence
of one who is rude in speech or conduct, and
in this has the advantage of the home; but
the person who practices good form in society,
and by a sullen, fault-finding, or untidy
manner at home flatly contradicts every pretense
of refinement, shall surely have his
reward in the covert contempt of even those
who love him; while any, however untrained
in the arts of &ldquo;polite society,&rdquo; who shall
practice those graces that make ordinary
duties fragrant and sweet with the good manners
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
of heaven, will be accepted anywhere
by any to whom he can be sent with a message.
Any awkwardness that a man may do
will be pardoned beforehand for the sake of
the beautiful spirit he is by the grace of God.</p>
<p>And yet it is well to make it just as hard
as possible for the world to reject you, and
just as easy as possible for it to accept your
message.</p>
<p>All of which is written for the glory of
our Lord, and to the end that the truth may
be carried to every creature.</p>
